a walkthrough of how the information gets from api endpoints to the users search results

cases:
1. list all fighters
    - call Cache::getFighters()
    - returns fighters if they exist in Cache
    - tries updating from cache file if they dont exist, saves into Cache
    - tries updating from fighters endpoint if they dont exist, saves into Cache
    - cache file updated on closing program?
2. click on fighter in list/ search fighter
    - call Cache::getFighter()
    - tries updating from cache file if fighters dont exist, saves into Cache // getting fighters from API is all or none
    - tries updating from fighters endpoint if fighters dont exist, saves into Cache
    - cache file updated on closing program?
    - if fighters exist but fighter not in it, no need to update, fighter doesnt exist
3. list all events by season
    - call Cache::getEventsInSeason(season)
    - similar to fighters, getting events from API is all or none for now
    - if events exist in Cache object, search and return
    - else check cache file and update from
    - else call schedule endpoint for all valid years and save
4. click on event in list/ search event by ID or name
    - Cache::getEventByID(id), Cache::getEventByName(name) // since all events retrieved from schedule these return if event exists
    - if event.fighters[] is empty, call event endpoint w/ eventID and update
5. click on fight from event
    - Cache::getFightByID, does not work like the other two, not all fights are retrieved at a time
    - if not found try fight endpoint w/ fightID and save
